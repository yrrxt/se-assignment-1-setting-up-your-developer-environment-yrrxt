# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.

DOCUMENTATION
I downloaded and installed visual studio code from the official website. I had some issues with the installation but so a classmate assisted me in installing another one. My classmate had the operating system in a hard drive which was used in putting it in my laptop.

I downloaded an IDE: Visual studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download , their official website and did not experience any issues.

I installed git and configured it on my machine. I also created a github account in the process. Everything went smoothly and no challenges were faced.

I was able to install python. It was challenging because I experienced some minor challenges. I was not able to see python in my path at the environment variables. I also couldn't find it on git. So I manually added python to my environment variables path and was able to locate it on my windows powershell but not on git. I wondered why. This documentations will show you how simple mistakes give one so much stress and patience is key. so the solution to being able to find python on git was just to restart my git bash and there it was! Python installation successful. I ensured it was functional by running pip --version in my command line after Python installation.

Downloaded and installed MySQL database from dev.mysql.com and fortunately it was successful.

I  explored and installed extensions within Visual Studio Code to enhance functionality for my specific needs such as python.

During all these processes, I ensured my environment was secure by configuring firewalls, updating software regularly, and using strong passwords. I also installed additional tool and libraries such as nodejs.

My projects and repositories can be accessed on my github account at https://github.com/yrrxt
